ParkedIn helps people find parking in Chicago, pay for spots, and manage reservations without circling the block for hours. ðŸš— Itâ€™s built with Flask blueprints for clean structure, using routes for users, lots, payments, reservations, and vehicles. It handles login, CRUD operations, and database management like a pro valetâ€”so you can focus on getting parked, not parking.
